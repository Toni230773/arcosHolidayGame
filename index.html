There was Daddy Duck, who had the biggest beak in the family; Mommy Duck, who loved to keep everyone organized; and their two ducklings, Quackers (the adventurous one) and Peep (the funny one who always made everyone laugh).
One sunny morning, Daddy Duck quacked loudly, “Pack your feathers, everyone! We’re going on vacation to Mallorca! We’re staying at the Arcos Playa Apartments in S’Illot!”
“Yay!” shouted Quackers, flapping his tiny wings.
“Do they have a pool?” asked Peep.
“They have a pool and they’re right next to the beach!” Mommy Duck said with a smile`,

“I’m jumping in the pool right now!” shouted Quackers.
“Wait, Quackers!” said Mommy Duck. “We need to check in first!”
At the reception desk, the receptionist smiled and said, “Welcome to Arcos Playa Apartments! You’re staying in Apartment 23, with a view of the pool!”
“That’s perfect!” said Daddy Duck. “I can keep an eye on Quackers from the balcony.”

“Look at me! I’m a flamingo-duck!” Peep quacked, wobbling on the float. Everyone around the pool laughed. Even Daddy Duck couldn’t stop chuckling.
But then Quackers tried to jump onto the flamingo, and SPLASH! Both ducklings fell into the water. “Quackers! You ruined my flamingo act!” said Peep, but then they both started laughing so hard that bubbles came up from the water.

The little ducklings, Quackers and Peep, built the biggest sandcastle ever — complete with a moat that filled up when the waves came in! Mama Duck relaxed under a big yellow umbrella, sipping a cool lemonade, while Papa Duck taught Peep how to jump over the waves without getting his feathers too wet (although they definitely got soaked a few times!).`

On their third day, the Duck family waddled to the beach. Daddy Duck brought his fishing rod, Mommy Duck brought her sunglasses, and the ducklings brought a big bucket for collecting seashells.
“Let’s see who can find the coolest shell!” said Quackers.
Peep found a shell shaped like a heart. “Look! It’s for you, Mommy Duck!”
Quackers found a shell with a crab inside. “Look! It’s alive!” he shouted, running around the beach with the crab pinching the edge of the bucket.
“Quackers, stop scaring the crab!” said Mommy Duck, but she couldn’t help laughing. Even Daddy Duck chuckled so hard he almost dropped his fishing rod.

After a big breakfast, they went on a boat tour around the coast. Pip and Poppy pretended they were pirate captains searching for treasure. They spotted colorful fish, caves, and even a dolphin jumping near the boat!
Mommy Daisy suggested a little adventure: finding a secret beach! With a picnic packed, they set off along the rocky paths. After a short adventure, they found a tiny cove with crystal-clear water, just for themselves. They splashed, played, and laughed until the sun started to dip.
The Duck family waddled to the local market in S'Illot. There were stalls full of bright fruits, shiny souvenirs, and mouth-watering smells. They bought sweet strawberries and little bracelets.
Quacker and Peep each got a double-scoop ice cream cone (Peep dropped his scoop, but a kind waiter gave him another!). Sticky, giggly, and happy, they waddled back to Arcos Playa for a nap by the pool.    After all that day it was time to go to bed

On their fifth night, the family joined the karaoke contest at Arcos Playa. Daddy Duck sang a terrible version of “Dancing Duck Queen,” and everyone laughed so hard they couldn’t even quack.
Then it was Peep and Quackers’ turn. They sang a silly song they made up:
"We’re the ducklings, we’re here to play,
Swimming and quacking all the day!
Mallorca’s fun, Arcos Playa’s the best,
We’ll sing and laugh till it’s time to rest!"
The crowd cheered and clapped. Even the receptionist from the front desk came to watch! “You two are going to be famous!” she said.

        On the sixth day of their vacation, the Duck family woke up to a bright and sunny morning. Quackers and Peep were bubbling with excitement because Mommy Duck had planned a treasure hunt around the Arcos Playa Apartments!
“Today, we’re going to find hidden treasures!” Mommy Duck announced, holding a colorful map. “Each clue will lead you to the next one, and at the end, there’s a special surprise!”
“Yay! I love surprises!” quacked Quackers, flapping his wings.
“Me too! What do you think it is?” asked Peep, bouncing up and down.

“To find the first treasure, go where the water is cool,
Jump in the pool, and look for a tool!”
“Let’s go!” shouted Quackers, racing to the pool. Peep followed closely behind, trying to keep up. When they reached the pool, they dove in and searched everywhere.
Suddenly, Peep spotted something shiny at the bottom. “Look, Quackers! It’s a little toy shovel!”

The Second Clue 🏖️
The second clue was hidden inside the shovel. It read:
“Now that you have a tool, it’s time for some fun,
Head to the beach where you can run!”
The ducklings quacked with joy and waddled as fast as they could to the beach. `,

“Not a treasure, but it’s pretty!” Quackers said, laughing.

After a while, they found a small box buried in the sand. Inside was the next clue:
“You’re getting closer, you’re doing so well,
To find the treasure, go where the ducks yell!”
“Where do ducks yell?” asked Peep, scratching his head.
“I know! The playground!” Quackers quacked excitedly.
They raced to the playground, where they saw a big slide and swings. As they played, they heard a loud quacking sound. “It’s coming from the slide!” Peep shouted.

At the bottom of the slide, they found a colorful treasure chest! They opened it together, and inside were chocolate coins, stickers, and a big golden trophy that said, “Best Duck Adventurers!”
“Wow! This is the best treasure ever!” Quackers quacked, his eyes sparkling.
“Let’s share the chocolate coins with everyone at the pool!” suggested Peep.
So, the Duck family headed back to the pool, where they shared their treasure with all their new friends. Everyone cheered for Quackers and Peep, and they felt like true adventurers.
As the sun began to set, the Duck family sat by the pool, enjoying their treats and laughing about their exciting day.
“Tomorrow is our last day, but I can’t wait to tell everyone about our treasure hunt!” said Quackers.
“Me too! This vacation has been the best!” Peep replied, munching on a chocolate coin.
And with that, the Duck family ended their sixth day with happy hearts and full bellies, ready for one last adventure before heading home.

They waddled down to the small harbor, where colorful boats bobbed gently in the clear blue water. Soon they climbed aboard a little white boat, their feathers ruffling in the sea breeze. As the boat set off, the family quacked happily and waved to the people on the shore.
The boat glided over the sparkling sea, and the ducks watched the waves dance around them. They spotted tiny fish swimming below and even saw a group of dolphins jumping in the distance! Everyone clapped their wings with excitement and leaned over the side to get a better look.

After a while, the boat anchored near a hidden cove. The family jumped into the shallow water, laughing and splashing. They swam, floated, and explored the rocky shore, where they found bright crabs and shiny pebbles. It felt like their own secret paradise.
When they returned to Arcos Playa Apartments later that afternoon, they were tired but full of happy memories. They ended the day with a quiet walk along the beach, watching the stars begin to twinkle above.
As they snuggled into their cozy beds that night, the Duck family agreed — this had been one of the best days yet.

“Yes,” said Mommy Duck. “But don’t worry, we’ll come back next year!”
At the airport, Peep looked out the window of the plane and said, “Goodbye, Arcos Playa! We’ll miss you!”
“And the beach!” said Quackers.
“And the pool!” said Mommy Duck.
“And karaoke night!” added Daddy Duck.
The whole family laughed as the plane flew back home.
